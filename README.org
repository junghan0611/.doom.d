After 10 years of standard Emacs keybindings this was a big jump.

Enjoy and be patient if traveling the same waters.

** Wanderson Ferreira - Evil Doom

April 30, 2022

Doom Emacs + Evil mode. I'm enjoying a lot. After 10 years of standard Emacs
keybindings this was a big jump. Enjoy and be patient if traveling the same
waters.

** Practicalli Doom Emacs Config

A personal configuration for Doom Emacs with a focus on creating a similar key binding and menu experience to that of Spacemacs, as [[https://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][Practicalli has used Spacemacs since 2015]].

*** To Archive

Practicalli is not actively developing this configuration, although it should be
useable with current versions of Doom Emacs and Emacs 28 onward as it is mostly
key binding configuration.

*** Overview

Doom Emacs default key bindings have been changed significantly and further
changes will be made as this project evolves. Therefore this configuration is
probably not directly applicable for those already comfortable with the Doom
Emacs maintainers workflow (although there are quite a few commonalities).

둠 이맥스의 기본 키 바인딩이 크게 변경되었으며 이 프로젝트가 발전함에 따라 추가
변경이 이루어질 예정입니다. 따라서 이 구성은 (몇 가지 공통점이 있긴 하지만) 이미
Doom Emacs 유지관리자 워크플로에 익숙한 사용자에게는 직접 적용되지 않을 수도
있습니다.

*** Notable key binding changes

~+bindings.el~ contains all the additonal, remapped and delete Doom key bindings
to provide a more mnemonic menu. Module specific configurations may also contain
key bindings that override the Doom defaults.

The most noticalbe key bindings changed from the Doom Emacs defaults include:

~,~ is set to local leader and ~SPC~ remains the leader key

~SPC TAB~ jumps to previous buffer

~SPC l TAB~ jumps to previously selected workspace (layout in Spacemacs terms)

~SPC g s~ opens Magit status (rather than stage hunk at point)

~fd~ alternative key binding to pressing ~ESC~ key

*** Org-mode [1/2]

- [-] Pretty checkboxes [1/2]
  - [X] Added code from practicalli/spacemacs.d
  - [ ] Review why checkbox icons not being used
- [ ] Review org-mode key bindings
  - [ ]  ~, b d~ to add code blocks via babel demarcate

*** Screencasts

~SPC t k~ to enable ~keycast-mode~ which shows key bindings and commands in the
modeline as you type, exspecially useful for screencasts (or to learn what
commands the key bindings are calling)

*** Git

For Commit message buffer Doom key binding kept rather than use Spacemacs:

- ~Z Z~ rather than ~, ,~ to confirm the message and commit
- ~Z Q~ rather than ~, k~ to cancel the message without commit

*** Clojure

~+clojure.el~ configuration overrides many CIDER variables defined in the clojure Doom module, as well as adding keybindings similar to the Spacemacs Clojure layer.
